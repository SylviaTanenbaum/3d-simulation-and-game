3d simulation and game
=========

open source cross platform 3d engine for virtual reality and games
 If we just want to CREATE a 2d representation of the points it would be relatively easy to program in any reasonably efficient language such as either C++ or Java.
 
 This is one of simple coding & implementation.The source code is compiled onto code which runs on a Java virtual machine (JVM). Sun provides virtual machines for the platforms supported.
